# VSink Tweaks
<H1>Our client <H1>


This is my first time making a github repository. Please don't hate me, If you want the full source code, go download the zip from releases "# VSink-Tweaks-VRC-Quest-Mod" 

  
  <p> I figure that I should tell you how to use the mod</p>

  <p> to use it, you go into the mod tab and press a cpu setting, gpu setting, and frame rate </p>
  
  <p> this mod does the same thing as uning side quest to change the cpu and gpu levels, and framerate max but it's not a vrc quest mod</p>
